# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Background

This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This project analyzed ride-sharing data by city type including urban, suburban, and rural, from January 2019 to April 2019. The results will assist decision-makers at PyBer.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data for urban, suburban, and rural cities.

## Results

### Ride-sharing Results by City Type

The results show the highest number of rides for urban cities was 1,625 while rural cities had the lowest at 125. The results also show that although the urban cities' average fare per ride was the lowest at $24.53 and the average fare per driver at $16.57, these cities had the highest total of drivers at 2,405 and total fares at $39,854.38. Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 and the lowest total fares at $4,327.93. These cities also had the highest average rate per driver at $55.49 and the lowest number of drivers at 78. Suburban cities fell in the middle with 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, $19,356.33 total fares, $30.97 for average fare per ride, and $39.50 as the average fare per driver (See Table One and Graph One).

Suburban / 625 /	490	/ $19,356.33	/ $30.97	/ $39.50

## Summary

The three business recommendations resulting from the analysis for ride-sharing data by city type in addressing any disparities among city types include:
- Hire more drivers in rural and suburban cities to be available.
- Decrease the average fare per ride in rural and suburban cities to increase the number of individuals who can afford the services. Hence, increasing revenue similar to urban cities.
- Offer discounts or coupons to frequent riders from rural and suburban cities.
